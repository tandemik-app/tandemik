Test Project: Vercel Deployment Check  This repository is a small test project deployed on Vercel to verify that I still remember the full workflow of modern deployments. It’s not meant to be a feature-rich app, but rather a proof of concept – from local setup, through GitHub, all the way to automatic deployment on Vercel.
